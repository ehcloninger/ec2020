  title: Glass Auto.
  caption: I found a mechanic in OKC that specializes in LBCs (Little British Cars). He spent 6 weeks working on her. At this point, he's replaced the radiator and has the engine tuned. He spent most of those 6 weeks waiting on brake parts.

  title: Front glass.
  caption: I'm reluctant to replace the front glass because I don't want to lose that sticker. The first family member to own the car was my sisters' father-in-law. He was a professor at the local university, where I got my Bachelor's degree. I had him for 2 classes and he didn't hold any grudges against me just because my sister married his son.

  title: Powder coating.
  caption: I had the original rims burnt and powder-coated while the car was up on jackstands at the mechanic. The new tires look really nice. After talking with the mechanic, I ordered some polished steel wheel rings.
