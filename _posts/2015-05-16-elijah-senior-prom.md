For his Junior Prom, Elijah and 2 of his friends rented a limo for them and their dates. For his senior
Prom, he went solo and wanted to drive the MGB. So, we spent a couple days doing some cleanup on it.

We used old-fashioned rubbing compound and fine steel wool to get rid of all the old oxidation. Then
we washed and waxed her. I masked off the tires and spray painted the rims white. It wasn't bad for a
weekend job.
