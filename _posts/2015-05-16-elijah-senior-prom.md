We've had the MGB since Elijah was 3 years old. It's always been our fun car.

For his Junior Prom, Elijah and 2 of his friends rented a limo for them and their dates. For his senior
Prom, he went solo and wanted to drive the MGB. So, we spent a couple days doing some cleanup on it.

We used old-fashioned rubbing compound and fine steel wool to get rid of all the old oxidation. Then
we washed and waxed her. I masked off the tires and spray painted the rims white. It wasn't bad for a
weekend job.

Here are some shots of Elijah and his sister with the car as he was about to head out that night.

I'll spare the details, but let's say that the MGB came home with a little less paint than it left with.
Subsequent photos show a bit of damage over the front passenger fender.
