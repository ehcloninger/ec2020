I dropped Pearline off at Glass Auto in OKC on in the middle of August. Two weeks later, I had a doctor
appointment nearby, so I stopped by to get Mike's estimate. I'm not going to lie, I was really apprehensive
walking in the door because I didn't know what I was going to hear.

The first prognosis was there are a bunch of small things wrong--none of them fatal. She just needed parts and
time to fix the things that were wrong. He said it was apparent that a lot of different shade-tree mechanics
had their hands on her. He had the carbs tuned up and she turned right over. That was something that hadn't 
happened in years.

Here, you can see the first batch of boxes from Moss Motors that have carpets, the new convertible top, trunk
liners, and body trim. Oh, and a "free" Moss Motors catalog, which has a few gems.

Later that week, I stopped by the shop and dropped off the convertible top. There is an upholstery guy that
knows the trick to installing MGB tops that works out of the same garage. It only took him a few days to get
it installed on the frame and the frame on the car.

While I had the car at the mechanics, I took the rims to a powder-coating place in Oklahoma City called
ColorFast. They promised a 5 day turn-around and gave me a pretty good rate on the work. I went with the
anodyzed black color. I also bought new Cooper touring tires and had them put on the rims after the 
powder-coating was finished. I think they turned out pretty nice. 

I ordered a set of chrome steel tire rings to go on the rims when everything is complete.
