I got Pearline back from Mike at Glass Auto on a Saturday in early October. It was a cloudy, cool day, so 
not a great day for driving with the top down. My girlfriend dropped me off at the garage and then drove on 
to an appointment. I spent half and hour talking with the usual suspects that hang around the garage on a 
Saturday morning and drove home through a light mist.

The next day was warm and bright. A perfect day to get started on Phase 2.
