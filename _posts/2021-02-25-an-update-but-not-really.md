It's been a long 6 weeks since the last post, so here's where we stand on the body
work and paint.

<!--more-->

We're exactly where we were 6 weeks ago. A couple of big things have happened in the
meantime. First, the entire shop came down with COVID in late January, so they shut
everything down for 2 weeks.

Then, in early February, our area was hit with a massive winter storm. I'm sure you
heard all about how Texas was inconvenienced. We're further north, but we didn't 
complain 1/10th as loud as our cousins in Baja Oklahoma. This area was in single
digit temps (Fahrenheit) for 11 days. The body shop couldn't do much in those temps.
The owner says he has a bit of a backlog now, but hopes to start painting my car in
early March.

On the plus side, I took my seats to the same upholsterer that did my convertible
top. I bought all new interior cushions and new fabric. He should have the seats ready 
by early next week.
