<h2>About Me</h2>

I'm a software developer and product/project manager at Samsung Electronics. My CV is on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericcloninger/).

<h2>About This Site</h2>

<h3>Development</h3>

This site is hosted on Amazon S3, which typically costs me less than $2.00 per month for 
the hosting. I recently switched from using Atom to VS Code and I'm finding myself working 
more on my projects than spending time to get my environment to do what I need. Since I'm 
a bit old-school, I tend to work in the Bash shell most of the time, using Ubuntu 18LTS 
under the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

I based this site on an existing theme, which I've done several times. With this version of the
site, I'm trying to get to an easier process that requires fewer bash scripts and help to get 
published. Ideally, it should be possible to clone my repo and use `bundle install` to get all
the dependent packages needed to build.

For me now, I can simply use `jekyll build` to create my site and `s3cmd sync` to deploy to 
Amazon S3.
